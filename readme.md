Welcome to HelixLib.

It's currently very WIP. The concept is here; just gotta work on some cool ways of handling it.

For example, the server could have all instances of the client / server / universal scripts.
If a client has mismatched files, throw some kind of error on _them_. Because they're tampering.
Or mark a file to be configurable. Lots of options. Lots of ideas.

My grand idea is that you only need to have HelixLib installed and you do not need to even reference
any of the DLLs, MoonSharp- Anything. I'd like it to be able to observe Github repositories of Lua scripts
organized in a similar file structure to save on uploading a whole ass mod to the DB just for
changing one little behavior or value.

That's all in the future, though. For now, it's just working on getting things working.
